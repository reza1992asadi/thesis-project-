the purpose of this project was to give windows users the ability to create documents for the android reader app which was done by my friend . since the android app recognizes the documents in JSON format , this project converts the documents to JSON format , and is also able to read the JSON format and turn it to a regular document with headers and text body . the main challenge for the program was to read JSON and turn it back to a normal header and text document , the built in library didn't work so I did it manually .
